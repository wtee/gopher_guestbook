Gopher Guestbook
----------------

This project is here as a piece of history. The code was written in
2009 in Perl 5 and worked with the Bucktooth gopher server.

By bending the usage of the Gopher protocol's query type and the non-standardized
information type, I was able to replicate the functionality of the guestbooks that
littered the personal websites of the 90s in Gopherspace, another quaint bit of
internet history.

This code is probably also particularly terrible because it's from when
I was first teaching myself to program. :/
